WORD FROM THE DEVELOPERS:

Thanks to the incredible team we have built over at our discord and reddit, we are able to shorten the first Public Release Date from our estimation of Late June, to early March and possibly late February.

We now have a developer dedicated to working on Pysics (being implemented sometime in update // 1.0.1.0 (according to our roadmap).

We now also have 2 Alpha testers focused on finding and reporting bugs and errors hidden in the game and the script itself.
